            <h1>Security comes standard with subscription licensing.</h1>
            <p>Every year, businesses lose billions of dollars due to insecure and badly written software. It doesn’t
                have to be this way.</p>
            <p>Security lapses are costly setbacks that businesses can‘t afford—and neither can we. That’s why we’re
                committed to going beyond publishing “just a text editor” so that you never have to worry if our
                products are safe, if they’re compatible with the latest tech and OS updates, or if new threats and
                vulnerabilities are addressed quickly.</p>
            <p>If reducing risk is as important to you as it is to us, then our flexible enterprise subscription
                licensing is the simple and stress-free way to ensure you’re always protected. With enterprise
                subscription licensing, you’ll benefit from:</p>
            <h1> Priority Access</h1>
            <p>Get immediate updates, patches, and hotfixes to keep your software secure and up-to-date.</p>
            <h1>Compliance Assurance</h1>
            <p>Enjoy priority handling for software compliance issues, ensuring you meet industry regulations and
                standards effortlessly. (We helped one company save hours in deployment costs in compliance with a local
                legal regulation. What can we do for you?)</p>
            <h1> Dedicated Support</h1>
            <p>Access priority technical support and Tier 3 engineering assistance for any security-related concerns.

            <div>Why not use a free solution instead?</div>
            <p class="top">Balancing the demands of your global and diverse workforce with the pressures of compliance,
                security, and risk mitigation isn’t always easy. But professionally supported software like UltraEdit
                makes it easier.
            </p>
            <h3>Empower your teams with professionally supported software.</h3>
            <p class="top">Free and open source software offers up-front cost savings, but that’s where it ends.
                Consider the following questions before turning to a free solution:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Who are you going to turn to when that free software introduces a vulnerability or risk to your
                    organization?</li>
                <li>What are your options when an update introduces instability or incompatibility to your developers or
                    teams?</li>
                <li>How can you ensure the tools you’re using internally will meet both the immediate and future needs
                    of the business? </li>
                <li>What happens when new regulations force urgent requirements on the free tool?</li>
                <li>What happens when a new security policy requires product changes?</li>
            </ol>
            <div>The value of professionally supported software becomes evident with a simple cost-benefit analysis.
